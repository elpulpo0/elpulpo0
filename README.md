## What You Should Know About Me

I describe myself in one word: **Passion**.

Originally from Belgium, I transitioned from a career in printing and graphic design to pursue my fascination with development. After an eye-opening journey in Australia and Indonesia, I returned with a desire to make a difference, volunteering with refugees and animal protection organizations.

In 2017, I founded **Unwhite It**, an association dedicated to urban art, leading various projects and collaborations.

### ðŸš€ My Journey into Development

In 2023, I pivoted my career toward the **blockchain** and **AI** sectors. I embarked on a training program at Simplon in Nice, focusing on AI development. Currently, Iâ€™m working on a web app that analyzes on-chain data in real time.
