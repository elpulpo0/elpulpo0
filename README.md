# 👋 Hi, I’m **El Pulpo**

## What You Should Know About Me

I define myself in one word: **Passion** — a driving force behind every project I take on.

Coming from a creative background, I transitioned from a career in printing and graphic design to pursue my fascination with development. After an eye-opening journey abroad, I returned with a desire to make a difference, volunteering with various organizations.

In 2017, I founded an association dedicated to urban art, leading various projects and collaborations.

### 🚀 My Journey into Development

In 2023, I pivoted my career toward the **blockchain** and **AI** sectors. I embarked on an intensive training program focusing on AI development. Currently, I’m working on a web app that analyzes on-chain data in real time.  

I am also actively developing **AI agents** and working on improving the **MultiversX plugin** for **ElizaOS**.
